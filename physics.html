        <h2 class="text-secondary">Bose Einstein Condensation Summary</h2>
        <h3>
            For my dissertation, I simulated a system of ring-coupled condensates Bose Einstein Condensates. Put simply,
            I solved the equations of motion for the system using a simple programme. For a more "scientific"
            explanation, I've included the abstract below.

        <h2 class="text-secondary">Density Functional Theory Summary</h2>
        <h3>
            For a separate project, I summarised various aspects of a scientific field known as 'Density functional Theory'.
            It's basically a way of understanding the properties of various materials or molecules by using a computer
            model of the system. It has numerous applications in a range of scientific fields. Such as improving the
            efficiency of solar cells by understanding how water behaves on the surface. It has extensive applications in
            medicine, for example better understanding how drugs bind to the HIV−1 PR virus.

        <h2 class="text-secondary">Bose Einstein Condensation Abstract</h2>
        <h3>
            A system of ring-coupled condensates is considered in-which the dynamics of the system will be stud-
            ied. The coupled Gross-Pitanaevskii Equations that describe the dynamics of the system in terms of the
            population imbalance and a phase difference are derived. Firstly, a double-well potential is considered. An
            an-harmonic generalization is then used to discuss the Josephson effect and plasma oscillations. A non-
            linear regime analogy of a pendulum is used to better understand the physics of these systems. Λ and the
            initial conditions completely govern the properties of the Josephson tunneling in a symmetric potential. For
            Λ < λ c , where λ c is a critical value, sinusoidal oscillations are found to occur. At λ c , the oscillations become
            an-harmonic. The energy difference ∆E in the asymmetric potential is found to produce a running phase
            without self-trapping occurring under the right conditions. Macroscopic quantum self-trapping
            occurs in the
            p
            asymmetric potential when the parameter Λ exceeds a crossover value defined as Λ s = 1/ 1 − z(0) 2 . Triple
            well systems were also investigated and similar oscillations were also found.

        <h2 class="text-secondary">Density Functional Theory Abstract</h2>
        <h3>
            Density functional theory makes it possible for the ground state properties of a system of electrons in an
            external field to be determined by the electron density distribution alone. The Kohn-Sham equations will
            be derived and the approximations used will be discussed. This review will highlight various applications
            of the Car-Parrinello method for material science, condensed matter physics and medicine. There will be a
            particular focus on reviewing recent papers that apply the Car-Parrinello method to the liquid structure of
            water.
